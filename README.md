# mr-gallery

An app that shows a grid of images, fetched from an API (authenticated with a token) with the ability to show 
more details and the full size image. `Infinity scroll is implemented`, so you just have to scroll down for more images to load.

Disclaimer: I tried several image libraries, such as `V-Viewer` and `vue-easy-lightbox` but I didn'get the them to 
work properly for the requirements of the test, so I lost some serious time
